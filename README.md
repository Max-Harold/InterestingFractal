# A Fractal That I Think Looks Interesting

One day I was doodling in class and made this drawing: <br>

And then I realized this can be a fractal generating pattern. <br>
So I created it in python in both Turtle and Tkinter. <br>

You can run it in python with the command:<br>
````
python tkinter_fractal.pyw
````
Or you can download the ['bin' version](https://github.com/Max-Harold/InterestingFractal/tree/bin) to run it as an application in the folder 'dist/tkinter_fractal'
